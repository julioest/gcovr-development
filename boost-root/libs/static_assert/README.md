Boost StaticAssert Library
============================

The Boost StaticAssert library provides static assertions for C++, this library is the ancestor to C++ native static_assert's and 
can be used on older compilers which don't have that feature.

This library has been merged into [Boost.Config](https://github.com/boostorg/config). The full documentation is available on [boost.org](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/config).
